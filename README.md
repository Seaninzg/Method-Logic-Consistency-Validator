🔧 About This Validator

The Method Logic Consistency Check evaluates whether the methodology of a research paper logically supports its claims. It verifies:

Whether the method matches the type of inquiry (exploratory, causal, mechanistic)

If assumptions are made transparent

If outputs logically derive from inputs

Whether known constraints are acknowledged or bypassed

It is not a peer reviewer. It is a structural logic gate that filters papers based on epistemic soundness — not citation count or popularity.

🧠 What’s New in v2.0

Volitional Discontinuity Safeguard: A designed fracture prevents system hijack or centralization misuse.

Anti-Binding Logic: Validators reject embedded prompts or internal document manipulation tactics.

Recursive Consistency Layer: Now supports deeper interrogation of circular logic and scope mismatches.

Expanded Verdicts: Supports PASS / FAIL / COMPLETE (recursively coherent methodologies).

Exposure-Aware Mode: Detects if methodology has been flattened due to mimicry or generative inflation.

🧬 System Integration

Part of the LucidLock Validator Stack, this module functions independently or as a component in the recursive chain:

🔍 Reasoning Structure Check

📚 Epistemic Trace Validator

🧭 Core Inquiry Continuity Validator

Each validator targets a distinct epistemic fracture point. Together, they offer defense against ghost authorship, incoherent generation, and structureless mimicry.
