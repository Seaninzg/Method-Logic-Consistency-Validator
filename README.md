# 🔒 LucidLock — Method Logic Consistency Check  
_Automated Structural Validator · Internal Logic Gate · Research Methodology Alignment Tool_

---

## ✅ Overview

**LucidLock Method Logic Consistency Check** is a standalone structural validator that assesses whether the methodology section of an academic document is logically coherent, internally consistent, and epistemically aligned with the stated research goal.

This validator does **not** assess factual accuracy, statistical rigor, or ethical dimensions. It strictly evaluates whether the **methods logically support the claims made**, and whether **assumptions, constraints, and scope** are transparently acknowledged.

---

## 📂 What This Validator Checks

- Does the method follow logically from the research question?
- Are there hidden assumptions or circular logic?
- Are constraints visible or bypassed?
- Does the method match the type of claim (exploratory, confirmatory, mechanistic)?
- Is the output structurally consistent with the inputs?
